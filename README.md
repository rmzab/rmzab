👋 Hi, I'm Ryan!
Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a Systems Engineering Manager by day, where I lead technical teams and solve complex problems for DoD messaging systems. By night, I'm a husband, father, and aspiring home chef, trading in legacy systems for legacy recipes.

I'm on a journey to blend my technical expertise with my passions. My current mission is to dive deep into Python and AI to build tools that streamline the parts of my job I'm less fond of (hello, technical writing!) and to create apps that bring a little more joy and organization to my family life.

🌱 What I'm Currently Focused On
👨‍💻 Building AI Agents: I'm exploring how to use Python and LLMs to create agentic tools that can automate and improve technical documentation and analysis. My goal is to make the tedious parts of my job faster and more efficient.

🍳 Developing a personal web application: This is my current passion project where I'm applying my front-end skills. I'm building a clean and simple web app using React to solve a practical, everyday problem related to home and family organization. It's a great way for me to practice modern development techniques on a project from concept to completion.

🌿 Growing My Skills: I'm always learning. Right now, I'm sharpening my skills in modern web development and diving into the world of AI orchestration frameworks.

🛠️ My Tech Stack & Tools
Here are some of the technologies I work with regularly or am currently learning:

Languages: Python, Java, (and learning the ropes of) JavaScript

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS

AI/ML: LangChain, Ollama, OpenAI & Gemini APIs

Databases: MySQL, MSSQL

OS: Windows Server, RHEL

Tools: VS Code, Git & GitHub, Jira, Docker

hobbies and interests
When I'm not in front of a screen, you can usually find me:

Cooking: Experimenting with new recipes and trying to perfect the classics. My goal is to cook more with fresh ingredients, and I'm even starting an indoor herb garden!

Playing Music: Strumming my guitar and mandolin, and slowly but surely brushing up on reading music.

Spending Time with Family

Staying Active: Focused on my health through walking and better nutrition.
